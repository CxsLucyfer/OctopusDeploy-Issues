Thanks for taking the time to log an issue.

However, we want our backlog to reflect things we've committed to doing in the near future.

If you've found a bug or something isn't working, please [contact support](http://octopusdeploy.com/support) instead. We don't read new GitHub issues regularly, so if you post here it will likely not get a reply. But if you contact support we can probably help to find a workaround or make sure the issue gets prioritized properly.

If you have an idea or a feature request, please post it to [our UserVoice site]
