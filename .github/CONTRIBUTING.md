This repository is used to manage the backlog for Octopus Deploy. 

## Do not create issues here directly

We want our backlog to reflect things we've committed to doing in the near future, and we like to keep it to below 50 items or less. 

If you've found a bug or something isn't working, please get in touch with [our support team](https://octopus.com/support) instead. We don't read new GitHub issues regularly, so if you post here it will likely not get a reply. But if you contact support we can probably help to find a workaround or make sure the issue gets prioritized properly. 

If you have an suggestion or a feature request, please post it to [our UserVoice site](https://octopusdeploy.uservoice.com) so others can vote for it.
