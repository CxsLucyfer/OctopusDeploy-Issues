Octopus 2.0 Preview/Beta Program
==================================

If you're viewing this page, you have agreed to be part of the preview/beta program for Octopus Deploy 2.0. We've been working on this release for nearly 6 months, and a lot has changed! Because there's so many changes, we expect there's going to be a period of instability. This preview/beta program is meant to help identify and fix those issues so that we can improve the product and get it out. Your participation in the program is vital, and we sincerely thank you for helping us out. 

## Areas to target

While we're always open for any feedback, right now, we're primarily after feedback in the areas of:

 * The initial setup experience
 * Any crashes or problems you have getting things to work
