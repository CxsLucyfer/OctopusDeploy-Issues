Octopus 2.0 beta program
==================================

We've been working on this release for nearly 6 months, and a lot has changed! Because there's so many changes, we expect there's going to be a period of instability. This preview/beta program is meant to help identify and fix those issues so that we can improve the product and get it out. Your participation in the program is vital, and we sincerely thank you for helping us out!
