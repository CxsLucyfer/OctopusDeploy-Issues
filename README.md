Octopus 2.0 release candidate
==================================

We've been working on the 2.0 release of Octopus Deploy for nearly 6 months, and a lot has changed! Because there are so many changes, there will naturally be we expect there's going to be a period of instability. This preview/beta program is meant to help identify and fix those issues so that we can improve the product and get it out. 

**Do NOT install this beta release on the same server as your current Octopus Deploy 1.X production server. It should work side by side, but there's a chance things could go very wrong.**

Current version: **2.0.5.933** (Octopus 2.0 Release Candidate)
